# NEATTRAK
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topoologies for Reversing Articulation and Kinematics

This project is written entirely in Unity C#
It takes live positional input from HTC VIVE Trackers and analyzes it to match probable avatar positions. There are components for raw and optimized data export to compare other ml methods.
Using a NEAT implementation makes this model very flexible. This flexibility is required to account for more creative tracker placement in the future.
